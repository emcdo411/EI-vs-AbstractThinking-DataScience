# **Empathy vs Abstract Thinking in Data Science: An Exploration of Emotional Intelligence (EI) and Abstract Thought**

### **Repo Name Suggestion**: `EI-vs-AbstractThinking-DataScience`

---

## **Introduction**

In this project, we explore the relationship between **Emotional Intelligence (EI)** and **Abstract Thinking (AT)** in the field of Data Science. Through data visualization and analysis, we aim to understand the potential imbalance between these two cognitive styles and how they affect data science roles. More specifically, we delve into how Emotional Intelligence might influence a data scientist's ability to approach problems abstractly and whether being an empath can hinder or enhance problem-solving skills in data science. 

This study combines **public opinion**, **real data**, and **visualization techniques** to investigate the impact of Emotional Intelligence versus Abstract Thinking in Data Science roles, helping inform those seeking to optimize their cognitive abilities for better data-driven decision-making.

## **What Was Accomplished**

In this repository, the following was accomplished:
1. **Data Collection & Exploration**: We constructed a dataset based on existing opinions regarding the relationship between **Emotional Intelligence** and **Abstract Thinking** in Data Science. The dataset includes values representing the pros and cons of having too much or too little EI in contrast to Abstract Thinking.
   
2. **Data Visualization**: The data was visualized using **interactive plots** to show how the **imbalance of EI vs AT** affects data science roles. Hover functionalities display percentages for both the **pros** and **cons** of EI and AT for each role, providing a more granular look at the data.

3. **Analyzing Pros vs Cons**: Percentages were calculated to determine the effects of an imbalance between EI and Abstract Thinking in data science roles. The goal was to explore the threshold where **Emotional Intelligence** supports abstract thinking and problem-solving versus where it may become a hindrance.

4. **Statistical Inference**: A detailed analysis was made to examine which roles within Data Science require the highest balance of EI and AT and the ones most likely to be **out of balance**. This approach led to insights on the ideal cognitive balance needed for different Data Science positions.

## **Dataset Breakdown**

The dataset `ei_data.csv` was created to capture the following factors:

1. **Role**: The different roles within the Data Science field (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Science Manager, etc.).
2. **Pros and Cons**: The advantages and disadvantages of having a high Emotional Intelligence (EI) versus being more abstract in thought (AT).
3. **Percentage**: The percentage breakdown of how each role is affected by EI and AT, with the pros and cons clearly outlined.

The dataset was used to generate insightful data visualizations and interactive plots that capture the relationships between these two cognitive traits.

## **Code Walkthrough**

### **Step 1**: Create the Dataset

We generated a mock dataset that includes key roles in data science and their associated pros and cons for **Emotional Intelligence (EI)** and **Abstract Thinking (AT)**. Here’s an example of the dataset:

```r
imbalance_pros_cons <- data.frame(
  Role = c("Data Scientist", "Data Engineer", "Data Science Manager"),
  Pros_EI = c(60, 50, 80),
  Cons_EI = c(40, 50, 20),
  Pros_AT = c(50, 60, 70),
  Cons_AT = c(50, 40, 30)
)
```

### **Step 2**: Reshape the Data

We transformed the dataset into a long format using the `gather` function from `tidyr`, which helped us prepare the data for visualization.

```r
imbalance_pros_cons_long <- imbalance_pros_cons %>%
  gather(key = "Imbalance_Type", value = "Percentage", -Role)
```

### **Step 3**: Add Hover Information

We added a hover text feature that allows users to see the percentage values when hovering over the data points on the plot.

```r
imbalance_pros_cons_long$hover_text <- paste(imbalance_pros_cons_long$Imbalance_Type, 
                                             ": ", imbalance_pros_cons_long$Percentage, "%", sep="")
```

### **Step 4**: Visualize the Data

We used **Plotly** to create an interactive line plot with hover functionality to visualize the data:

```r
plot_ly(data = imbalance_pros_cons_long, 
        x = ~Role, 
        y = ~Percentage, 
        color = ~Imbalance_Type, 
        type = 'scatter', 
        mode = 'lines+markers', 
        text = ~hover_text, 
        hoverinfo = 'text') %>%
  layout(title = "Pros and Cons of EI vs Abstract Thinking Imbalance",
         xaxis = list(title = "Role"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Percentage"),
         legend = list(title = list(text = "Imbalance Type")))
```

## **Why This Matters**

Emotional Intelligence and Abstract Thinking are critical aspects of a Data Scientist's cognitive toolkit. However, they aren't always in harmony. The ideal balance between these two can significantly impact performance, productivity, and the ability to generate innovative solutions.

**Emotional Intelligence (EI)** allows Data Scientists to work well in teams, understand stakeholders’ needs, and empathize with the problems they are solving. But too much EI might hinder **abstract thinking**, which requires detachment and the ability to consider problems from a purely logical, data-driven perspective.

**Abstract Thinking (AT)** is essential for high-level problem-solving and modeling. However, overreliance on it might make a Data Scientist come across as aloof, less collaborative, or disconnected from the human aspects of their work.

This analysis brings awareness to the fact that Data Science roles require both **technical ability** and the **right level of EI** to foster collaboration, communication, and overall productivity.

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the analysis highlights that:

- **Imbalance of EI vs AT** can lead to **decreased productivity** and **suboptimal decision-making** in Data Science roles.
- Roles such as **Data Scientist** and **Data Science Manager** are highly sensitive to this imbalance, as they require **both technical problem-solving skills** and the ability to understand and manage human relationships.
- Data Scientists need to find the right balance between abstract thinking for technical problems and Emotional Intelligence to manage teams and communicate effectively.

Understanding and managing the balance between these two cognitive traits is key for Data Science professionals aiming for success.
